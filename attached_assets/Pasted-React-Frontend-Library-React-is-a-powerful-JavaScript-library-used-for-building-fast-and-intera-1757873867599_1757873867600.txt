React (Frontend Library)
•	React is a powerful JavaScript library used for building fast and interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
•	React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and maintain clean, modular code.
•	React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render only the components that change, improving performance.
•	React provides hooks such as useState and useEffect, making it easier to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components.
•	React integrates seamlessly with tools like Redux, React Router, and Next.js, enabling advanced state management and routing.
•	React is maintained by Meta (Facebook) and supported by a huge open-source community, ensuring continuous improvements and resources.

Node.js (Backend Runtime Environment)
•	Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 engine, enabling developers to run JavaScript outside the browser.
•	Node.js allows building server-side applications using JavaScript, which unifies frontend and backend development under a single language.
•	Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly scalable and efficient for real-time applications.
•	Node.js has a rich ecosystem through npm (Node Package Manager), which provides millions of libraries and tools for rapid development.
•	Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, and real-time apps like chat systems using WebSockets.
•	Node.js is often paired with frameworks such as Express.js, NestJS, and Koa, which simplify backend development.

MongoDB (Database)
•	MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility.
•	MongoDB stores data in BSON (binary JSON) format, making it easy to work with JavaScript-based applications like Node.js.
•	MongoDB is schema-less, allowing developers to build applications without strict schemas and adapt to changing data requirements.
•	MongoDB supports horizontal scaling with replication and sharding, making it suitable for handling large datasets and distributed systems.
•	MongoDB provides a powerful query language and aggregation framework for complex data operations and analytics.
•	MongoDB integrates naturally with Node.js and React (as part of the MERN stack), making it a popular choice for modern full-stack development.
